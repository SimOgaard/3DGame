Noman's Rain is a roguelike game that mixes elements from Risk of Rain 2 (roguelike genre) and No Man's Sky (space exploration). In Noman's Rain you have to kill enemies to gain a random upgrade. The difficulty level in the game increases with time, the longer you play the harder the game becomes. You move forward in the game by launching yourself to another planet.
